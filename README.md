## Rules
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Why TDD:
__Go fast forver__ 🏎
> Teams that practice Extreme Programming (XP) believe that the best software is built through a process of learning, which requires them to continuously deliver software into the hands of users, get their feedback, and iterate on the product in response to that. You can’t do that if you’re on that first curve. You need the second curve. You need to GO FAST FOREVER.
